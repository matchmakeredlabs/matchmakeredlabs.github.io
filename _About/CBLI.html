<h1>The Competency-based Learning Industry (CBLI) <br/> A Rapid Growth Industry</h1>

<p class="text-center">
    In the Competency-based Learning Industry, in this moment, the opportunity to<br/> <span class="mm-hover" data-toggle="tooltip" title="expand into new markets, differentiate/customize product offerings, grow revenue, etc.">grow your business</span> and/or
    <span class="mm-hover" data-toggle="tooltip" title="increases in successful hire rates, required knowledge mastered, seamless jurisdictional transfers, etc.">improve your success metrics</span><br/>
     has never been greater.
</p>

<p>According to McKinsey & Company, the postsecondary education and training industry is estimated at $1.1 Trillion. Of this, estimated spending on US workforce-development programs which are overwhelmingly competency-based (everything from federal and state jobs programs, workforce training and certifications, community college, and employer training)â€”is greater than $300 Billion a year.
In K-12 alone, spending on competency-based learning is projected to exceed $30 million in 2021. With significant growth anticipated in all areas of competency-based learning, the creation of effective enabling solutions for this market represents a massive business opportunity.</p>
