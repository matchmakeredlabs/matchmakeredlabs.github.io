# An Example of an Institutional Transfer Challenge:

## A student must transfer from one University to another

A student is pursuing a mechanical engineering degree at the University of Texas.  For family reasons, the student must relocate and will be transferring to the University of Vermont. While both degree granting programs address the same competencies, each program documents those competencies using different language and structure. Current solutions are inadequate to produce mappings from the University of Texas that the University of Vermont will accept.  
**Enter MatchMaker:**

As a result of MatchMaker Education Labs’ rich matching technology, all parties in the institutional transfer value chain win:

1. Both the originating and the receiving institutions know exactly how applicants measure up to each set of program requirements.
2. With minimal institutional effort, students are able to continue working toward their degree while receiving credit for their prior work.
3. Students can successfully navigate life’s obstacles with minimal impact on their ability to gain employment in their chosen field.  Notably, due to the transparency provided by the MatchMaker platform, employers receiving graduates know exactly what skills and competencies they are hiring into their organization.

Win - Win - Win
