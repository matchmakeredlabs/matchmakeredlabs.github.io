# Scenario Product Development - Example Multiple Market Selling 

## A CBL-based learning resource provider employs MatchMaker to inform development<br/>&<br/>via MatchMaker, a CBL-based institution can validate how well their needs are met

Each year various States conduct textbook adoptions.  Each of the fifty states approach K-12 curricular requirements differently. While most States address largely the same standards, competencies, and skills, each jurisdiction documents those using different language and organization. Due to the nuanced differences between State’s Curriculum Standards, the mapping of competencies, skills, and requirements across various jurisdictions has proven extremely challenging and an ongoing cost for suppliers of learning resources. *Enter MatchMaker Education Labs:*
