# Scenario A Job Transtion: Example Emergency Medical Technician (EMT)
## The VA’s HR provider integrates MatchMaker & city governments, hospitals, & technical schools use this functionality


Each year the Veteran’s Administration works diligently to place veterans into civilian roles. When there are known shortages in fields such as Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs), all too often military certified skills are not readily accepted by organizations such as a city government seeking to hire EMTs. This is frequently the case even when a candidate is clearly over-qualified, has years of experience, but lacks a civilian certification. *Enter MatchMaker Education Labs:*

As a result of MatchMaker Education Labs’ rich matching technology, all parties in the certification alignment value chain win.

1. The Veteran’s Administration successfully places veterans into civilian roles, as promised in the recruitment process.
2. Civilian organizations (e.g., cities, hospitals, clinics, businesses, etc.) confidently hire qualified veterans (job candidates).
3. Veterans (job candidates) seamlessly transition into the civilian job market.
