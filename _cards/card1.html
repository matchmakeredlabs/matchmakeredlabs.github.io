According to McKinsey & Company research, the postsecondary education and training industry is estimated at $1.1 Trillion. Of this, estimated spending on US workforce-development programs which are overwhelmingly competency-based (everything from federal and state jobs programs, workforce training and certifications, community college, and employer training)—is at least $300 Billion a year.<br/><br/>

Competency-based learning (from cradle to gray) and the implications for workforce development are increasingly obvious.  Formal competency-based education/instruction is making inroads in higher education, and even in K12. In K12 alone, spending on competency-based learning is projected to exceed $30M in 2021. With similar growth anticipated in all areas of competency-based learning, public and private, the identification of competency-based solutions represents a massive business opportunity.

estimated that in K12 alone, the CBL market will exceed <span class="mm-hover" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sturgis/CompetencyWorks (October 2016) Reaching the Tipping Point: Insights on Advancing Competency Education in New England"></span>$30M</span>.
