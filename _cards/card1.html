<p>According to McKinsey & Company research, the postsecondary education and training industry is estimated at $1.1 Trillion. Of this, estimated spending on US workforce-development programs which are overwhelmingly competency-based (everything from federal and state jobs programs, workforce training and certifications, community college, and employer training)—is at least $300 Billion a year.</p> 
<p>Competency-based learning (from cradle to grave) and the implications for workforce development are increasingly obvious.  Formal competency-based education/instruction is making inroads in higher education, and even in K-12. In K-12 alone, spending on competency-based learning is projected to exceed <span class="mm-hover" data-toggle="tooltip" title="Sturgis/CompetencyWorks (October 2016) Reaching the Tipping Point: Insights on Advancing Competency Education in New England"> $30 Million </span> in 2021. With similar growth anticipated in all areas of competency-based learning, public and private, the identification of competency-based solutions represents a massive business opportunity.</p>
