# The Competency Based Learning Industry (CBLI) <br/> A Rapid Growth Industry

In the CBL ecosystem, in this moment in time, the opportunity to:<br/>•	grow your business<br/>(e.g., expand into new markets, differentiate/customize product offereings, grow revenue, etc.)<br/>                                                        and/or<br/>•	improve your success metrics<br/>(increases in successful hire rates, required knowledge mastered, seamless jurisdictional transfers, etc.),<br/>is akin to the moment in 1853 when Strauss introduced Levi Jeans to the Goldrush.
<br/>In 2016, prior to the pandemic which has further accelerated market growth, Sturgis* estimated that in K12 alone, the CBL market will exceed $30M. With similar growth anticipated in all CBL segments to include Work Force Development (WFD), incluing both public and private sectors, the CBLI represents a massive opportunity.<br/>Cradle to grave, Matchmaker’s highly extensible solution enables educational suppliers and organizations (our customers and partners), conducting business or operating in CBL, to include:<br/>•	publishers, platforms, products, service providers<br/>                               as well as<br/>•	governments, organizations, and institutions<br/>to<br/>•	develop for and/or sell into any CBL vertical<br/>(K12, HiEd, Corporate, Trades, Military, Government, etc.)<br/>                                   and/or<br/>•	select/sort and/or train/teach candidates/learners.<br/>(school/program admittance, identification of unmet requirements, cross-jurisdictional certification alignments, etc.)
