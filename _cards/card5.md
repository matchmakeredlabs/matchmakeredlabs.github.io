# An Example of a Product Uptake Challenge:

## The product offering addresses all of your customer’s requirements, yet it is not being used and the follow-on sale depends on usage rates

The market is demanding the ability to quickly identify and personalize/customize learning resources such that instructors and students have just-in-time access to just-the-right learning resources. Unfortunately, current matching solutions simply fall short of that aspiration. The result, your customers are unable to run a query that surfaces your compelling offering(s) which, in fact, best address their instructional needs.  
**Enter MatchMaker:**

As a result of MatchMaker Education Labs’ rich matching technology, all parties in learning resource access and retrieval value chain win:

1. Your pertinent resources will be found!
2. Institutions and educators find the best resources to address their students’ needs.
3. Students have access to learning resources that enable them to master required competencies.

Win - Win - Win
